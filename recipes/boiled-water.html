        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Literally boiling water. It's steamy and... uh... boiling. You know... like... uhhhh. I don't know what to say really. English is not my native language, give me a break.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Take water and increase the temperature of it to 100 degrees C.</li>
            <li>BOOM! You got boiling water! Now you can pour it on those pesky attackers trying to break through the gates or make yourself some tea, forget about it and drink it when it's cold and not that great anymore.</li>
            <li>Watch out! Water is now becoming steam and can escape to atmosphere!</li>
            <li> <b>CRAZY LIFEHACK!</b> If you have any leftover boiling water you can freeze it, store it in the fridge and reheat it when you need it! (take it out of the fridge first)</li>
        
        </ol>
